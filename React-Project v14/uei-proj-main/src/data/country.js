While research on fake news is considerably high, the research on AI-generated deep fake video is still in the infancy stage. Following this need, the prime objective of this research is to develop a proactive, advanced explainable, human collaborated AI-based online disinformation detecting tool for securing a trustworthy social media environment. The aim is to build technological capability for algorithmic fake video detection. that could be installed or delivered as a service.",
